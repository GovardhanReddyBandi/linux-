/ it stands for FORWARDS SLASH
\ it stands for BACKWARD SLASH

*IN WINDOWS DEFAULT USER ARE ADMIN(ADMINISTARATOR) he we can do what ever we want
	***IN WINDOWS***
				C
DESKTOPS	DOWNLODS	LOCALDISK D	LOCALDISK E 	ETC

*IN LINUX default user are 1)root(like a ADMIN)(he can insttall,delet,create sof)
			  2)ec2-user (normal user)
***IN LINUX****
			/
root	home	opt	mnt	bin	sbin	tmp 

*IN LINUX 
syntax: cd / then ls
output : bin dev home lib media opt root sbin sys usr boot etc lib local mnt proc run srv tmp var(it will display available files in "/")

bin= it contains commands used by all user (including root)

sbin = it stands for super bin = it will also contains the commands these commands only used by root

opt= optinal = we can store the tirdparty softwares(optinal agreement)
mnt=mount= drives(Gdrives all under comp under mnt)
etc= it contains all configuration files

proc =it contains all the process

boot = to start the server/bootup it requires many file to run =bootable files

var = variables=it contains all variable/log

home

root

*AS A NORMAL USER WE CAN SWITCH TO ANY LOCATION. BUT WHERE EVER TO CREATE FILE(OR)FOLDER AND DELETE A FILE (OR)FOLDER WILL NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE EC2-USER IS ANORMAL USER.
*FOR A NORMAL USER HAVE "HOME" IN LINUX(/) WE CAN CREATE (OR)DELETE A FILE OR FOLDERIN NORMAL USER =/HOME/EC2-USER
***what is a default home dir for normal user?
	/home/username
***what is default home dir for root user?
	/root
sudo -i (is a command used for to switch normal user to root user)
for normal user(ec2-user) $, root user #
***root user can crete and delete any file or folder where ever we want
*EX:if we want to create a file in opt 
	login to ec2 service in putty
	switch to root user sudo -i
	 cd / (changes directory to "/")
	pwd (it shows present working directory)
	ls (to list all files/folder in "/")
	cd /opt (change dirctory to opt)
	touch <filename> (to create a empty file)
	ls (it list the file in opt now you can see the file which was created by u)
EX:if we want to create a folder in opt 
	login to ec2 service in putty
	switch to root user sudo -i
	 cd / (change directory to /)
	pwd (it shows present working directory)
	ls (to list all files/folders in "/")
	cd /opt (change dirctory to opt)
	mkdir <dirname> (to create a  "directory/folder")
	ls (it list the file/folders in opt now you can see the folder which was created by u.)
*****PATHS*****
	1.Absolute Path: it like a "complete path" (ex: cd/opt/filename)
	2.Relative Path: it like a "near Path" (ex: if we are in opt dir/fold we can enter a file in opt by giving command cd <file/foldername> we can go to that location of file/folder i,e Relative/near Path)
EX1: if PWD is / we want to go to sbin directory then,
	synatx: cd sbin  (because / path is a sbin dir) that is called Relative/Near by Path
EX2:if PWD is any where we want to go to sbin then,
	syntax:cd /sbin/ then ls (to list files) 	that is called Absolute/Complete Path
