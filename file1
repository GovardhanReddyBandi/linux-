****TO CREATE A FILE THEY ARE 3 COMMANDS*****
1.touch(we can create only empty files)
2.cat(EMPTY FILE,DATA FILE,WE CAN ADD DATA TO EXISTING FILE BUT WE CAN'T MODIFY DATA INSIDE THE DATA FILE)
3.vi (VIUAL EDITOR)
  
2.CAT
	it stands for concatenate
*here we can create a 1 file at a time
*to create a empty file syntax:cat > filename (empty file and ctrl+d to save it)
*to create a data file syntax: cat > filename <"write data here"> and ctrl+d to save it
*to check the data inside the file syntax: cat filename
*to add/append extra data to an existing file syntax: cat >> filename <"write data here"> and ctrl+d
****NOTE*****
WE CAN'T NOT MODIFY THE DTA INSIDE THE FILES


3.VIUAL EDITOR(vi)
	vi= touch+cat+modify the file
syntax: vi filename
	inside this they have 3 modes
	a.command mode(default mode)
	b.insert mode (i)
	c.colon mode (at saving/reject file syntax:esc :wq(to save and quit),esc :q (without save it will quit))
****note***** command: ! (indicates forecefully)
****note***** deafault mode is command mode


********************************************************
commands 
cd: it stand for change directory

	syntax: cd.. (to get back)

cp: it stands for copy

	to copy a dir without overide we use -r (recursevily)ex:cp -r dir1 dir2

mv: it stands for move
    here we rename the file and folder and
    we can move the files or directories for one location to other location
	syntax: mv file1 file5 (to rename the file1 to file5)
	syntax: mv dir1 dir5 (to move a dir "dir1 is source and dir5 is destination")

date: it will display the day,date,month and time according to servere created location

echo: it like a print command
	ex: echo "hi welcome to devops"
who -b =boot(starting the server)
	when my server is started

	it displays: system boot year-month-date time

whoami:who currently working (or) who currently executing commands (ec2-user)

logname: who intially log-in into the server(first login) (<ec2-user>)

sudo -i: when comand given sudo -i it will switch as a root user

	6dd "to delete the 6 lines"
****coloun mode***								****saving ***
	esc :w (OR) x to save file					x or w =save
	esc :q to quite the file					q = quite
	esc : wq to save and quite					q! =quite forcefully
note :default mode is command mode					wq = save and quite
***KEY STORE & USES****							wq! = save and quite forcefully
	K (moves the courser up)
	J (moves the cursor down)
	H (moves the cursor left)
	L (moves the cursor right)

	*s =search
	*i = means fom first line
	*$ = means from last line

EX: after opening the file with vi my cursor by default cursur will start of first line first word first character but in want my cursor at 15 th line while opening the file with vi
	ans: vi <filename> + 15
EX: to display cursor on 15th in the filename where total lines =20
	ans: head -13 <filename> | tail -1
			OR
	    : tail -10 <filename> | head -3
*****key stores and Actions***

A		write after cursor (goes into insert mode)
a		write at the end of line (goes into insert mode)
ESC		Terminate insert mode
u		undo last changes
